# C++11/C++14 Compatible Binary Search Tree Implementation(BST)

## Purposes
This project has a educational/research character, so I'm
not pretending to make something great or very beautiful.
It's just a code, that works, and works well :)

## Build
In terminal, type

`mkdir build && cd build/`

`cmake ..`

`make && ./bstree`

## ToDo's
* Implement tree initialization with std::initializer_list
* Implement tree initialization from a file
* Add comprasion functions support(Functors support)
* And, of course, don't forget to drink a cup of coffee :)
